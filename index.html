            <h3>Get to know Stray Kids a little bit</h3>
            <p>
              This K-POP boy group was formed under
              <em>JYP Entertainment</em> and the group contains eight members:
              <strong
                >Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin,
                and I.N</strong
              >. It's common that record labels in South Korea to choose every
              members of a group they want to debut but JYP chose to do
              something different when forming this group. JYP chose Bang Chan
              to be the leader of Stray Kids and then let Bang Chan choose the
              rest of the members he wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The group's name "Stray Kids" was not defined by
              <em>JYP Entertainment</em> but conceptualized by the members
              themselves. It originally referred to a lost child who wants to
              chase their dreams and later evolved to represent the idea of
              finding a way together out of the ordinary.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are considered a "self-producing" idol group as the members
              are almost always involved in songwriting and composing, and
              sometimes assist in arranging. Though the main producers in Stray
              Kids is Bang Chan, Changbin and Han, and as their own unit they
              are called 3RACHA.
